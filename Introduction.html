  Hi everyone, this is my blog and we are going to be doing alot on this page. 
  I know you might be asking what a blog is.Well i tell you that a blog is 
  a page where you write about things you would love to tell people
  without the use of voice communication, instead they just read the
  feed you have written on the page. This blog of mine will be showcasing
  alot here. And you would not regret reading this blog. Well you can read
  the subtopics to know what part of the blog you are reading. There would also
  be links you can just click on to go to the next topic of the day. As you switch
  there would be more different page colours you would love. You could choose
  your own personal topic from the topics list. There are a lot of topics on
  the topics list.Let me just give you some topics you might be seeing frequently
  on the topics list. They are: Bullying, Sex education and so on . Well i guess

  me the writer.
  <h2 style="color:blue;">ABOUT THE WRITER</h2> 
  My name is Adegoke Precious Funmilayo. I am 11 years old. I was born on
  Saturday 2nd June 2012. I am a student of Imperial Lights college, The secondary
  school of Little Light School. I am in Year 8 Gold. I would be moving on to
  Year 8 when it is september.dren. I am a science student studying the course MEDICINE
  Well i know not all secondary schools do it but in my school, we do Physics,
  Chemistry and biology immediately we get into Year 7.
  <h2 style="color:darkblue;">WHAT INSPIRED ME TO CREATE THIS BLOG</h2>
  Alot of people inspired me to create this blog. My first inspirer was my mom.
  She told me i could do anything if i put my mind to it. And with that i 
  realized that i could try something different. My second inspirer who was
  kind of my competitor was my friend seunfunmi Balogun. She made her own
  blog which made me kind of jealous because our teacher complimented her and told her 
  she would be on the platform. With that i almost died of jealousy when i 
  heard that. With that i knew i could do better. And my last inspirer was
  my Coding teacher Mr emmanuel who thought i was just a class distraction
  but with this blog i will prove to him that i am not just a distraction
  i could do something good too. Let me introduce you to some of my friends
  in this next subtopic. let us get a move on.
