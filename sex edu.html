<h1>Sex education</h1>

<h3>Why children should not practice sex</h3>
Sex is for married couples and children are not to 
practice sex until they are well educated married and 
ready to handle the consequences. Before you have sex as a girl child
you should ask yourself these following questions:
<p>1. Are you ready to breastfeed your child?</p>
<p>2. Are you ready to drop out of school to care for your child?</p>
<p>3. Are you ready to face embarassment from your
    colleagues?</p>
<p>4. Are you ready to be mocked by your neighbours?</p>
<p>5. Are you ready to undergo pushing in the hospital?</p>
<p>6. Are you ready to carry a child in your womb
for nine months?</p>
<p>7. Are you ready to be a mother?</p>
With those questions in a girl child's mind, i am sure
she would make the right choice and choose to abstain from
sex.
<p>As a male child before you have sex you should
ask yourself these following questions:</p>
<p>1. Are you ready to be a father?</p>
