<h1>FRIENDSHIP</h1>
<h2>What is friendship?</h2>
Friendship is a state of being emotionally attached to another person resulting from the feeling
of affection.
It is also a warm and intimate relationship with someone you like and trust. It often does not
involve any sexual interactions. Friendship is very important to adolescents because it helps
to ease their transition from childhood to adulthood. It provides opportunity for acquiring
experience which would aid the process of developing a self identity and promotes the ability
to socialize.
<h2>TYPES OF FRIENDSHIP</h2>
There are different types of friends. While some are close friends, others are not so close, 
Yet others are mere acquintances, i.e. people you know but you do not consider as friends.
