    <h1 style="color:forestgreen;">INTRODUCTION</h1> 
    Hi everyone, this is my blog and we are going to be doing alot on this page. 
    I know you might be asking what a blog is.Well i tell you that a blog is 
    a page where you write about things you would love to tell people
    without the use of voice communication, instead they just read the
    feed you have written on the page. This blog of mine will be showcasing
    alot here. And you would not regret reading this blog. Well you can read
    the subtopics to know what part of the blog you are reading. There would also
    be links you can just click on to go to the next topic of the day. As you switch
    there would be more different page colours you would love. You could choose
    your own personal topic from the topics list. There are a lot of topics on
    the topics list.Let me just give you some topics you might be seeing frequently
    on the topics list. They are: Bullying, Sex education and so on .
         <h2 style="color:firebrick;">WHAT INSPIRED ME TO CREATE THIS BLOG</h2>
    Alot of people inspired me to create this blog. My first inspirer was my mom.
    She told me i could do anything if i put my mind to it. And with that i 
    realized that i could try something different. My second inspirer who was
    kind of my competitor was my friend seunfunmi Balogun. She made her own
    blog which made me kind of jealous because our teacher complimented her and told her 
    she would be on the platform. With that i was pushed to do my blog. My Coding teacher Mr Emmanuel who thought i was just a class distraction
    but with this blog i will prove to him that i am not just a distraction
    i could do something good too. Let me introduce you to some of my friends
    in this next subtopic. let us get a move on.
    <h2 style="color:deeppink;">MY FRIENDS</h2>
